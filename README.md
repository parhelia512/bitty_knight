***BE WARNED >>** I taught myself to code and therefore the code is unconventional*.     

 
This is the source code for the first game I made with Go. It is free to play on Steam for Windows and also works on Steam via Proton on Linux https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751370/Bitty_Knight/   

  
Made with the Go bindings for raylib https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go 

  
To compile from source you will need to install raylib-go and the required dependencies. 


Installation instructions are on the raylib-go page https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go


The spiritual successor (not sequel) and second game I made with raylib-go is much better https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968730/Mr_Snuggles_Dungeon_Adventure/


If you need help with raylib then Discord is the best choice https://discord.gg/raylib otherwise Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib
